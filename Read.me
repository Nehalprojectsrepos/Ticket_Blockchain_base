📌 EventChainTickets — README
🧠 Overview

EventChainTickets is a simple decentralized event ticketing DApp built on Ethereum.
It allows:

✅ Event hosts to create events with ticket limits & prices

💳 Users to purchase tickets (ERC721 NFTs)

🔄 Transfer tickets to other users

🌐 View owned tickets and related event info via a browser frontend

🧰 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

Remix IDE

MetaMask
 browser extension installed

Ganache
 running locally (Default RPC: http://127.0.0.1:7545)

A local Ethereum account imported into MetaMask using a Ganache private key

⚙️ Step 1: Start Ganache

Launch Ganache GUI

Start a new workspace (Quickstart is fine).

Note the RPC Server URL (e.g., HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545).

Copy one of the private keys from Ganache, and import it into MetaMask.

🟡 Ensure MetaMask network is set to Custom RPC → Ganache with Chain ID 1337.

🧱 Step 2: Deploy Contract on Remix

Open Remix IDE
.

Create a new file named EventChainTickets.sol.

Paste the entire Solidity contract into it.

Go to the Solidity Compiler tab:

Select 0.8.20

Click Compile EventChainTickets.sol ✅

Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab:

Environment: Injected Provider - MetaMask or Ganache Provider

Gas Limit: 10000000

Deploy the contract

Approve the MetaMask popup

✅ Once deployed, copy the deployed contract address shown in Remix → “Deployed Contracts” panel.

🌐 Step 3: Configure Frontend (HTML)

Here’s a basic HTML frontend that connects to MetaMask and lets users interact with the deployed contract 👇
Save this file as index.html in your project folder.
📝 Step 4: Run the Frontend

Open index.html in your browser.

Click “Connect Wallet” → MetaMask popup will appear → approve.

Use the forms to:

Create a new event (future date, some price like 0.01 ETH)

Copy its Event ID (starts from 1)

Buy tickets using the “Buy Ticket” form

Click “View My Tickets” to see your NFT tickets with event names 🎟

🧪 Testing Tips

If transactions fail due to gas → set Remix gas limit to 10000000.

Ganache doesn’t charge real ETH, so you can test freely.

If frontend doesn’t fetch data, make sure the ABI and address match the contract you deployed.

🚀 That’s It!

You now have a fully working local blockchain ticketing DApp:

✅ Smart contract deployed via Remix on Ganache

🌐 Frontend interacting via Web3.js and MetaMask
